# CS50 Nuggets
## Implementation Spec
### ctrl-zzz, Winter 2024

> This **template** includes some gray text meant to explain how to use the template; delete all of them in your document!

According to the [Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md), the Nuggets game requires two standalone programs: a client and a server.
Our design also includes grid, player, and spectator modules.
We describe each program and module separately.
We do not describe the `support` library nor the modules that enable features that go beyond the spec.
We avoid repeating information that is provided in the requirements spec.

## Plan for division of labor

- Edward will handle the server setup, focusing on communication. He'll cover testing and documentation for this.
- Eliana will write the grid module. She'll cover testing and documentation for this.
- Priscilla will handle the client, and working with ncurses. She'll cover testing and documentation for this.
- Karun will write the player and spectator modules. She'll cover testing and documentation for this.

## Player

### Data structures

Create a `localclient_t` data structure in order to hold information for each of the players that join the client.

This localclient data structure keeps track of the playerâ€™s characteristics such as playerID, purse, and the amount of gold remaining. It also keeps track of the size of the window, whether the player is a spectator, and the port number.


### Definition of function prototypes

#### Function Prototypes
```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]);
static bool handleMessage(void* arg, const addr_t from, const char* message);
static bool handleInput(void* arg);
static void cursesInit(); 
static void setupWindow();
static void displayMap(char* display);
static void displayTempMessage(const char* temp);
static void clearTempMessage();
static bool gameOk(const char* message);
static bool gameGrid(const char* message);
static bool gameGold(const char* message);
static void gameDisplay(const char* message);
static localclient_t* data_new();
```


`main` Initializes the client application, processes command-line arguments for server connection details, and manages the game's main loop. This function sets up the client's environment, including initializing the data structure and the messaging system, and then continuously handles user input and server messages until the game concludes.
```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]);
```


`handleMessage` Processes incoming messages from the server and dispatches them to appropriate handler functions based on the message type. This function is responsible for interpreting server commands such as game state updates, error messages, and game conclusion signals, ensuring that the client responds appropriately to each.
```c
handleMessage(void* arg, const addr_t from, const char* message);
static bool handleInput(void* arg);
```


`handleInput` Captures user input from the keyboard and sends corresponding actions to the server. This function is crucial for enabling player interaction with the game, allowing users to move around the map, collect gold, and communicate with other players or spectators.
```c
static bool handleInput(void* arg);
```


`cursesInit` Sets up the ncurses library for rendering the game interface. This function configures the terminal to support real-time input handling and graphical output, providing the foundation for the game's visual presentation.
```c
static void cursesInit(); 
```


`setupWindow` Prepares the initial game window, clearing any pre-existing content and setting it up for game display. This function is called after initializing curses to ensure that the game's graphical interface starts from a clean slate.
```c
static void setupWindow();
```


`displayMap` Renders the game map on the screen based on the latest layout received from the server. This function translates the server-provided map data into visual elements, updating the game window to reflect the current state of the game world.
```c
static void displayMap(char* display);
```


`displayTempMessage` Shows temporary messages, such as errors or notifications, at the top of the game window. This function ensures that important information is communicated to the player promptly without disrupting the game display.
```c
static void displayTempMessage(const char* temp);
```


`clearTempMessage` Removes any temporary messages currently displayed to the user. This function is typically called before showing a new message or updating the game window to keep the display uncluttered.
```c
static void clearTempMessage();
```


`gameOk` Handles the "OK" message from the server, which confirms successful communication or actions. This function might update the client state or UI to reflect the successful operation as indicated by the server.
```c
static bool gameOk(const char* message);
```


`gameGrid` Processes the "GRID" message containing the dimensions of the game map. This function updates the client's internal representation of the game world size, adjusting the display parameters accordingly.
```c
static bool gameGrid(const char* message);
```


`gameGold` Interprets the "GOLD" message from the server, which provides updates on gold collected by the player or remaining in the game. This function ensures that the player is kept informed about their progress and the state of the game.
```c
static bool gameGold(const char* message);
```


`gameDisplay` Updates the game window with the current map layout received from a "DISPLAY" message. This function ensures that the game map is accurately rendered on the user's screen, providing a visual representation of the game state.
```c
static void gameDisplay(const char* message);
```


`data_new` Allocates and initializes a new instance of the `localclient_t` data structure. This function sets up the foundational data model for the client, preparing it to handle and display the game state.
```c
static localclient_t* data_new();
```

## Grid module

### Data structures
Grid:
- Implemented as a 2-D array data structure
- Each cell holds information about the type of spot (boundary, hallway, nugget) and what is occupying the cell (either player or nugget pile).

Player:
- List with player's letter corresponding to index
- Hold pointers to Player structs (defined later), which contains information such as player's letter symbol, name location and nuggets in purse

### Definition of function prototypes
`grid_t* grid_load(char* filename)`: Loads the map file and initializes the game grid.

`int grid_init_gold(grid_t* grid)`: Drops gold piles on the grid at the start of the game.

`void grid_spawn_player(grid_t* grid, addr_t* connection_info, char* real_name)`: Randomly places a player onto a spot on the grid.

`void grid_spawn_spectator(grid_t* grid, spectator_t* spectator)`: Places a spectator and ensures only one spectator is present on the grid at one time.

`void grid_send_state(grid_t* grid, player_t* player)`: Sends the current game state to a player client.

`void grid_send_state_spectator(grid_t* grid, spectator_t* spectator)`: Sends the current game state to a spectator client.

`void grid_game_over(grid_t* grid)`: Handles the end of the game by preparing a summary and cleaning up.

** Getter functions included as helper functions to faciliatate easy integration.

	Allocate memory for a new grid structure
    Allocate and initialize memory for storing the number of rows and columns in the grid
    Initialize variables for counting rows, columns, and tracking the maximum number of columns
    Read through the file character by character:
        If a newline character is encountered:
            Increment the row count
            Update the maximum number of columns if the current row's column count is greater
            Reset the column count for the next row
        Otherwise, increment the column count for the current row

    Rewind the file to the beginning
    Read the file again to fill in the grid's cells:
        For each character in the file that is not a newline, assign it to the appropriate cell
        Fill in any remaining cells in a row with a default character if the row is shorter than the maximum column count
    Allocate and initialize additional properties of the grid (player count, nugget count, spectator count, arrays for players and spectators)
    Return the initialized grid

	  Initizlize gold total, min and max number of piles
    Initialize ndots to 0
    For each cell in the grid:

## Player module

### Data structures

The only extra data structure is the visibility layer, which is a 2D Boolean array.

### Definition of function prototypes

`player_t* player_new(addr_t* connection_info, char* real_name, int x, int y, int nrows, int ncols)`: Initializes a new player with specified name, connection info and position. Returns pointer to `player` struct.

`bool player_move(player_t* player, grid_t* grid, int dx, int dy) `: Updates the player's position and the location of conflicting players, calling `update_visibility` on all affected players, and sending a `DISPLAY` message to all clients with updated locations.

`void player_collect_gold(player_t* player, grid_t* grid, int gold_x, int gold_y)`: Updates the player's purse and the location of the gold piles, and sends a `GOLD` message to all clients with updated locations.

`void player_update_visibility(player_t* player, grid_t* grid)`: Updates the player's visibility layer. Called by `player_move`.

`void player_quit(player_t* player)`: Called by grid module when a player quits. Gracefully handles quit, then calls `player_delete`.

`player_delete(player_t* player, grid_t* grid)`: Deallocates memory associated with the player.

** Getter and setter functions included as helper functions to faciliatate easy integration. 

### Detailed pseudo code

#### `player_t* player_new(addr_t* connection_info, char* real_name, int x, int y, int nrows, int ncols)`
Trivial constructor for a new player.

#### `void player_move(player_t* player, int dx, int dy, grid_t* grid) `
```
    if (player->x + dx, player->y + dy) is a valid move:
        if there is a player in the new position:
            call player_move on the other player with the opposite dx and dy
            call update_visibility on the other player
        update player's position
        call update_visibility on the player
        if there is a gold pile in the new position:
            call player_collect_gold
        send a DISPLAY message to all clients with updated locations
    else:
        do nothing
```

#### `void player_collect_gold(player_t* player, grid_t* grid, int gold_x, int gold_y, grid_t* grid)`
```
    update player's purse
    update gold pile's value in grid
    decrement number of remaining gold piles in grid
    send a GOLD message to all clients with updated locations
```
#### `void player_update_visibility(player_t* player, grid_t* grid)`
This function is cached **[FOR EXTRA CREDIT]** in a hashmap: if **any** previous player has been at the spot, we store all cells that are visible from that spot. If not, we compute the visibility layer from scratch and cache it.
```
    x, y = player's position
    if (num_rows * x + y) is already cached:
        player->visibility = player_visibility OR cached // element-wise OR
    vis_cache = 2d array size of grid, initialized to 0s
    for each cell (i, j) in the grid
        compute functions get_y(x), get_x(y) for the line (point-slope)
        visible = True
        for p in [x, i]:
            if (p, floor(get_y(p))) and (p, ceil(get_y(p))) are both walls:
                visible = False
        for q in [y, j]:
            if (floor(get_x(q)), q) and (ceil(get_x(q)), q) are both walls:
                visible = False
        if visible:
            player->visibility[i][j] = 1
            cached[i][j] = 1
    cached[num_rows * x + y] = vis_cache
```
[Note: this algorithm runs in O(mn(m+n)) time, where the grid has size (m,n). We could optimize to O(mn) at the cost of simplicity, using trigonometry.]

#### `void player_quit(player_t* player)`
Trivial function that removes player from grid, then calls `player_delete`.
#### `player_delete(player_t* player),grid_t* grid`
Trivial function to delete.

## Spectator module

### Data structures
No specific data structures are used.

### Definition of function prototypes
`spectator_t* spectator_new(addr_t* connection_info)`: Initializes a new spectator with specified connection info. Returns pointer to `spectator` struct.

`addr_t* spectator_get_addr(spectator_t* spectator)`: Get the address of a spectator.

`void spectator_quit(spectator_t* player, grid_t* grid)`: Called by grid module when a player quits. Sends a `QUIT` message to server, and calls `spectator_delete`.

`spectator_delete(spectator_t* spectator)`: Deallocates memory associated with the spectator.

### Detailed pseudo code

#### `spectator_t* spectator_new(addr_t* connection_info)`
Initializes a new spectator with specified connection info. Returns pointer to `spectator` struct.

Trivial function to deallocate memory associated with the spectator.

---

## Testing plan

### Unit testing

`Grid Module`: Test loading from various map files, including edge cases like empty or exceptionally large maps. Check for proper initialization of gold and validation of grid dimensions. Test each grid manipulation function (e.g., grid_spawn_player, grid_init_gold) in isolation to ensure they behave as expected under different grid states.

`Player Module`: Create mock player objects and test functions such as player_move, player_collect_gold, and player_update_visibility. Use predefined grid states to ensure player movements and interactions are correctly handled.

`Spectator Module`: Test spectator creation and ensure that the spectator can correctly receive game state updates. Test the behavior when switching spectators.


### Integration testing

`Server`: Test the server's ability to handle multiple connections, manage game state, and correctly process and respond to messages from clients. This includes testing game initialization, player movements, gold collection, and spectator updates.

`Client`: Test the client's ability to parse server messages, update the local display correctly, and send appropriate responses back to the server. Verify the client's handling of different game states and transitions.

### system testing

`Client and Server Together`: Test the complete system by running the server and connecting multiple clients, including both players and spectators. Evaluate the system's performance in real-time gameplay, ensuring synchronization between server and clients, and verifying the correct game logic execution. Test scenarios include starting a game, player movements and interactions, gold collection, spectator viewing, and game termination.

---

## Limitations
`Spectator Limit`: Only one spectator is allowed at a time, limiting the number of people who can view the game state without participating

`Client Interface`: The client interface, particularly for handling user inputs and displaying the game state, may not be optimized for usability or accessibility.

`Scalability`: The system may not efficiently scale to support a very large number of players or spectators simultaneously due to limitations in server processing and network bandwidth.
