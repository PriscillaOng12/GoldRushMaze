EXTRA CREDIT features:
1) We added the ability to steal by making it so whenever a player bumps into another player, the moving player gets the gold from the stationary player added to their purse and the stationary player's purse gets reduced to 0. Also, if a player was just stolen from, they have an invincibility that is kept track with a bool in the player sruct, keeping them from being stolen from until they move again. This also applies to the stealer. Finally, all players are spawned in with invincibility to prevent unfair play.

2) We also added the feature that when a player quits the game, they drop the amount of gold they had in a pile that lies on their last location before quitting. When a player quits, all other players and the spectator are then updated on the current standing of gold in the game and the new DISPLAY with the gold pile that has been left behind. The total gold in the game is also updated accordingly by adding the quit player's purse to the previous total gold.
